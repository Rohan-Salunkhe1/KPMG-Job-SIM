## Introduction

Welcome to my KPMG Data Analytics Job Simulation project! My name is Rohan Salunkhe, and I am excited to share my journey and insights gained from completing the KPMG Data Analytics Job Simulation on Forage.

### Motivation

Aspiring to excel in the dynamic field of data analytics, I undertook the KPMG Data Analytics Job Simulation to sharpen my skills, tackle real-world challenges, and gain hands-on experience with tasks representative of a data analytics role at KPMG.

### Goals

Throughout this simulation, my primary goals were to:

- Apply and enhance my knowledge of data analytics tools and techniques.
- Develop proficiency in tasks such as exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and visualization.
- Gain a deeper understanding of the decision-making process in a business context through data.

This repository serves as a test to my dedication to continuous learning and my commitment to mastering the skills required for a successful career in data analytics.

## Tasks
